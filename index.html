                        <h3>My path to the dev side</h3>
                        <p>It really began around the age of 13, I was using very basic html and css to create pretty simple web pages. As well as using html to make my Myspace page the best like no one ever was. At the same time, I was working during the summer with my step-father at his computer shop, just tearing apart old machines and re-installing operating systems.

                        <h3>Skills I aquired on my journey</h3>
                        <p>A passion of mine is cooking, starting in early 2012 I began as a Chef at a prestigious restaurant. Why is this relevent to web design you may wonder? In my time as a chef there are a few skills that I bring with me wherever I go. First, is a skill that came from plating desserts, it showed me that seemingly random placement can actually be a beautiful flowing work of art. Cooking also showed me that taking risks, combining unlikely ingredients, and finesse could pay off greatly. I feel I try to implement these skills when designing a website, by taking risks with design and always striving to create something beautiful</p>

                        <h3>My journey continues...</h3>
                        <p>While cooking remains a passion, they pay and the hours were not great. I searched for a new job and found myself painting high end houses. In terms of design, this job was an amazing learning experience. I learned great skills like: color pairing, choosing accents or shadows, and mixing custom colors. I was also able to see lots of very modern homes giving me a great idea of what "modern design" looks like. I finally found what I was looking for in Software Development, after a year in school and learning about web design and development, I was hooked.</p>
